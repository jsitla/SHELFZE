# Multilingual OCR Update

## Enhancement
Added support for detecting milk in multiple languages, specifically to handle products like "Ovče mleko" (Sheep Milk).

## What Changed

### Multilingual Milk Keywords
Added detection for "milk" in various languages:
```javascript
const milkKeywords = [
  "milk",    // English
  "mleko",   // Serbian, Croatian, Polish, Czech
  "mleczny", // Polish (adjective)
  "lait",    // French
  "leche",   // Spanish
  "latte",   // Italian
  "milch"    // German
];
```

### Specific Milk Type Detection
Now detects and labels specific types of milk:

```javascript
if (text.includes("ovce") || text.includes("овче")) {
  itemName = "Sheep Milk";  // ✓
} else if (text.includes("goat")) {
  itemName = "Goat Milk";
} else if (text.includes("cow") || text.includes("whole") || text.includes("skim")) {
  itemName = "Milk";
} else {
  itemName = "Milk"; // Default
}
```

### Example: "Ovče mleko" Bottle

**OCR Text Detected:**
```
Ovče
mleko
[... other text ...]
```

**Detection Logic:**
1. Scan lines for milk keywords → Found "mleko" ✓
2. Check for specific type → Found "Ovče" (sheep) ✓
3. Result: **itemName = "Sheep Milk"** ✓
4. Category: "Dairy" ✓
5. Confidence: 0.85

## Before vs After

### Before
```
Scanned: Ovče mleko bottle
AI Labels: ["Dairy product", "Bottle", "Beverage"]
Result: "Dairy product" ❌
Category: Dairy ✓
```

### After
```
Scanned: Ovče mleko bottle
AI Labels: ["Dairy product", "Bottle", "Beverage"]
OCR Text: "Ovče mleko ..."
