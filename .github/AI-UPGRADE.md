# AI Upgrade: Better Food Content Recognition

## Problem
The previous implementation used **OBJECT_LOCALIZATION** which detects *physical objects* (bottle, jar, box), not the *content* inside them.

**Example Issue:**
- Scanned: Bottled milk
- Detected: "Bottle" or "Bottled and jarred packaged goods"
- **Should detect:** "Milk" (the content)

## Solution
Upgraded to use **LABEL_DETECTION** which uses advanced AI/ML to understand image content.

## What Changed

### 1. Vision API Features (3 instead of 2)
```javascript
// BEFORE: Only 2 features
features: [
  {type: "TEXT_DETECTION"},
  {type: "OBJECT_LOCALIZATION"},
]

// AFTER: 3 features with AI content understanding
features: [
  {type: "TEXT_DETECTION"},           // OCR for text
  {type: "LABEL_DETECTION", maxResults: 10}, // AI content understanding ✨
  {type: "OBJECT_LOCALIZATION"},      // Physical object detection
]
```

### 2. Detection Priority (AI Labels First)
```javascript
Priority 1: AI Labels (content understanding)
  ↓ "Milk", "Dairy product", "Beverage"
  
Priority 2: Text from image (brand names)
  ↓ "Organic Whole Milk"
  
Priority 3: Physical objects (containers)
  ↓ "Bottle", "Container" (IGNORED if no content found)
```

### 3. Container Words Filtering
Added intelligent filtering to **ignore container words**:
```javascript
const containerWords = [
  "bottle", 
  "jar", 
  "package", 
  "packaged goods",
  "container", 
  "box", 
  "can", 
  "carton"
];
```

**Why?** These words describe the container, not the food content.

### 4. Smart Detection Logic

#### Step 1: Check AI Labels (Skip Containers)
```javascript
for (const label of labels) {
  const labelLower = label.name.toLowerCase();
  
  // Skip container words
  if (containerWords.some(word => labelLower.includes(word))) {
    continue; // ← Ignore "bottle", check next label
  }
  
  // Check for food keywords
  if (keywords.some(keyword => labelLower.includes(keyword))) {
    itemName = label.name; // ← "Milk" ✓
    category = "Dairy";
    confidence = label.confidence;
    break;
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: Fallback to Objects (If No Label Match)
```javascript
// Only use objects if AI labels didn't find food
if (category === "Other") {
  for (const obj of objects) {
    // Same logic, skip containers, find food
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Enhance from Text
```javascript
// If confidence is low or no category, check OCR text
if (category === "Other" || confidence < 0.7) {
  // Look for brand names, product names in first 5 lines
  // Example: "ORGANIC WHOLE MILK" from label
}
```

## Example Results

### Before (Object Detection Only)
```
Bottled Milk scan:
  Detected: "Bottled and jarred packaged goods"
  Category: Packaged Food ❌
  Confidence: 85%
```

### After (AI Label Detection)
```
Bottled Milk scan:
  AI Labels: ["Milk", "Dairy product", "Beverage", "Bottle"]
  Filter out: "Bottle" (container word)
  Detected: "Milk" ✓
  Category: Dairy ✓
  Confidence: 95%
```

## Technical Details

### Google Vision API Features Comparison

| Feature | What It Detects | Use Case |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **TEXT_DETECTION** | Text/words in image (OCR) | Expiry dates, brand names |
| **LABEL_DETECTION** | Image content with AI | Food type, content understanding |
| **OBJECT_LOCALIZATION** | Physical objects with bounding boxes | Container shapes, positions |

### Label Detection AI
- Uses deep learning models trained on millions of images
- Understands context (milk in bottle vs empty bottle)
- Provides semantic understanding ("dairy product", not just "white liquid")
- Higher confidence for content vs containers

## Firestore Data Structure

Items now store **both labels and objects**:
```javascript
{
  itemName: "Milk",
  category: "Dairy",
  confidence: 0.95,
  detectedLabels: [
    {name: "Milk", confidence: 0.95, source: "label"},
    {name: "Dairy product", confidence: 0.92, source: "label"},
    {name: "Beverage", confidence: 0.88, source: "label"}
  ],
  detectedObjects: [
    {name: "Bottle", confidence: 0.87, source: "object"},
    {name: "Container", confidence: 0.82, source: "object"}
  ],
  expiryDate: "2025-10-15" || null,
  fullText: "ORGANIC WHOLE MILK...",
  addedAt: Timestamp
}
```

## Updated Food Categories

Added "milk" to Beverages category for better detection:
```javascript
"Beverages": [
  "drink", "juice", "soda", "water", "beverage",
  "cola", "sprite", "fanta", "beer", "wine", 
  "coffee", "tea", "energy drink", "smoothie", 
  "lemonade", 
  "milk" // ← Added for dairy beverages
]
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Cases

1. **Bottled Milk**
   - Expected: "Milk" or brand name
   - Category: Dairy or Beverages
   - Should NOT be "Bottle" or "Packaged goods"

2. **Jarred Sauce**
   - Expected: "Tomato sauce", "Ketchup", etc.
   - Category: Condiments
   - Should NOT be "Jar" or "Glass container"

3. **Canned Soda**
   - Expected: "Cola", "Soda", or brand name
   - Category: Beverages
   - Should NOT be "Can" or "Aluminum container"

4. **Boxed Cereal**
   - Expected: "Cereal" or brand name
   - Category: Packaged Food
   - Should NOT be "Box" or "Cardboard container"

### How to Verify
1. Scan item with camera
2. Check success message for item name
3. Verify in Firestore:
   - `detectedLabels` should contain content (milk, sauce, etc.)
   - `detectedObjects` may contain containers (bottle, jar, etc.)
   - `itemName` should be content, not container

## Benefits

✅ **Accurate Content Detection**: Understands WHAT'S INSIDE, not just the container  
✅ **Higher Confidence**: AI labels typically have 90%+ confidence  
✅ **Better Categorization**: Properly categorizes milk as Dairy, not Packaged Food  
✅ **Smart Filtering**: Ignores meaningless container words  
✅ **Dual Source**: Uses both AI labels AND objects for best results  

## Deployment

**Status**: ✅ Deployed  
**Function URL**: https://analyzeimage-awiyk42b4q-uc.a.run.app  
**Version**: Updated with LABEL_DETECTION (October 10, 2025)

## Next Steps

- Test with various packaged food items
- Monitor confidence scores in Firestore
- Add more container words if needed
- Consider adding CROP_HINTS for better label reading
