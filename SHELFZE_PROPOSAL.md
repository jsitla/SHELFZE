# Shelfze - Product Proposal

## The Problem

Every household faces three interconnected challenges that lead to significant waste of money, time, and resources:

### 1. 🗑️ Food Waste & Financial Loss

**40% of food purchased by households ends up in the trash.** For an average family spending $200/week on groceries, this translates to:

- **$80/week wasted** on food that expires before being used
- **$4,160/year** thrown directly into the garbage
- Environmental impact: wasted food is a major contributor to landfill methane emissions

**Why it happens:**
- People forget what's in their fridge and pantry
- Expiry dates go unnoticed until it's too late
- Duplicate purchases because "I'm not sure if we have that"

### 2. 🍳 The "What's for Dinner?" Dilemma

Every day, millions of people stare into a full refrigerator and say: *"There's nothing to eat."*

**The real problem isn't lack of food — it's lack of ideas.**

- Average time spent deciding what to cook: **20-30 minutes daily**
- Result: ordering takeout despite having ingredients at home
- Additional cost: **$15-40 per takeout meal** vs. $5-10 for home cooking

### 3. 📦 Pantry Chaos & Inefficiency

Without a system, pantries become black holes:

- Items get pushed to the back and forgotten
- No visibility into what's expiring soon
- Shopping trips are guesswork — buying things you already have
- No coordination among family members ("Did you buy milk?")
