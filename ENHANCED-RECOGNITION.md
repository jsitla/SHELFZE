## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Enhanced Spice & Ingredient Recognition**

#### Problem Solved:
Previously, the app couldn't distinguish between different forms of the same ingredient:
- ❌ "Garlic" (too generic)
- ❌ Couldn't tell fresh garlic from garlic powder

#### Solution Implemented:
AI now recognizes **SPECIFIC FORMS** of ingredients:

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Fresh Garlic Cloves** vs **Garlic Powder** vs **Minced Garlic**
- ✅ **Fresh Ginger Root** vs **Ground Ginger**
- ✅ **Whole Black Peppercorns** vs **Ground Black Pepper**
- ✅ **Fresh Basil Leaves** vs **Dried Basil**
- ✅ **Sea Salt (Coarse)** vs **Table Salt (Fine)**
- ✅ **Whole Cinnamon Sticks** vs **Ground Cinnamon**

#### How It Works:
The Gemini AI now:
1. **Analyzes texture and appearance** to determine form
2. **Reads packaging labels** for clues (e.g., "powder", "ground", "whole")
3. **Distinguishes fresh vs processed** ingredients
4. **Includes brand names** when visible
5. **Notes packaging type**: jar, bottle, bag, fresh, etc.

#### New Data Fields:
```json
{
  "productName": "Garlic Powder",
  "category": "spices",
  "form": "powder",  // NEW FIELD
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

**Possible `form` values:**
- `fresh` - Fresh, unprocessed ingredients
- `dried` - Dried herbs/fruits
- `ground` - Ground spices
- `powder` - Powdered form
- `whole` - Whole spices/ingredients
- `minced` - Pre-minced/chopped
- `frozen` - Frozen items
- `canned` - Canned goods
- `bottled` - Bottled items

### 2. **Video Recording Mode** 🎥

#### Why Video Mode?
**Problem:** Single photos might miss items or get poor angles
**Solution:** Record a short video panning across your pantry/spice rack

#### Benefits:
- 📹 **Better Coverage**: Capture multiple items at once
- 🔄 **Multiple Angles**: AI sees items from different perspectives
- 🎯 **Improved Accuracy**: More data = better recognition
- 🏪 **Pantry Scanning**: Perfect for scanning entire shelves

#### How to Use Video Mode:

**On Mobile:**
1. Open Scanner tab
2. Tap **"📷 Photo"** button to switch to **"🎥 Video"**
3. **Hold the record button** to start recording (max 10 seconds)
4. **Pan slowly** across your pantry/spices
5. **Release** to stop recording
6. AI processes the video for better recognition

**Visual Indicators:**
- 📷 **Photo Mode**: Green capture button - tap to snap
- 🎥 **Video Mode**: Red recording button - hold to record
- 🔴 **Recording**: "Recording... (Release to stop)" message

**On Web:**
- Video mode available on mobile only
- Web users continue using photo upload

## 🎯 Usage Guide

### For Spices & Seasonings:

#### ✅ Best Practices:
1. **Good Lighting**: Ensure labels are well-lit
2. **Clear Labels**: Make sure text is visible and in focus
3. **Capture Packaging**: Include the front label with product name
4. **One at a Time**: For photo mode, scan one spice container at a time
5. **Use Video for Racks**: For spice racks, use video mode

#### 📸 Photo Mode - Best For:
- Single item scanning
- Fresh produce
- Individual packages
- Quick scans

#### 🎥 Video Mode - Best For:
- **Spice racks** with multiple containers
- **Pantry shelves** with many items
- **Closets** with various ingredients
- **Better recognition** when photo fails

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Cloud Functions Enhancement:

**Enhanced Gemini Prompt:**
```javascript
const prompt = `You are a food recognition expert specializing in precise ingredient identification.

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
1. Detect MULTIPLE items if present
2. Be EXTREMELY SPECIFIC about the FORM:
   - Fresh vs Processed
   - Whole vs Ground
   - Powder vs Dried
3. For SPICES:
   - Check if POWDER/GROUND, WHOLE, or FRESH
   - Look at packaging text
   - Note texture and appearance
4. Include BRAND NAME if visible
5. TRANSLATE to user's language
6. Specify packaging type

Response includes "form" field!
`;
```

### CameraScanner Component Updates:

**New State Variables:**
```javascript
const [isRecording, setIsRecording] = useState(false);
const [recordingMode, setRecordingMode] = useState('photo'); // 'photo' or 'video'
```

**New Functions:**
- `startVideoRecording()` - Initiates video recording (max 10s)
- `stopVideoRecording()` - Stops recording
- `processVideoFrames(videoUri)` - Processes video for recognition
- `toggleRecordingMode()` - Switches between photo/video

**UI Enhancements:**
- Mode toggle button (Photo ⟷ Video)
- Recording indicator (red pulse effect)
- Helpful hints for each mode
- Long-press to record in video mode
