# üé• Video Recording Mode - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Video recording mode has been successfully implemented using the native `recordAsync()` API from expo-camera's CameraView component.

## Features

### üìπ Video Recording
- **Toggle Mode**: Switch between Photo Mode (üì∑) and Video Mode (üé•)
- **Max Duration**: 10 seconds of recording
- **Quality**: 720p resolution
- **Audio**: Audio recording enabled (not muted)
- **Live Timer**: Shows recording duration in real-time (e.g., "üî¥ Recording 3s / 10s")
- **Stop Control**: Red STOP button to end recording early

### UI Elements

#### Mode Toggle Button (Top)
- **Photo Mode (üì∑)**: Green button, "Single photo capture"
- **Video Mode (üé•)**: Shows "Record video for multiple items"
- **Disabled During Recording**: Can't switch modes while recording

#### Capture Button (Bottom)
- **Photo Mode**: Green circular button
- **Video Mode**: Red square button with üé• icon
- **Recording State**: Shows spinner, timer, and STOP button

### Technical Implementation

```javascript
// State Management
const [captureMode, setCaptureMode] = useState('photo'); // 'photo' or 'video'
const [isRecording, setIsRecording] = useState(false);
const [recordingDuration, setRecordingDuration] = useState(0);

// Start Recording
const startVideoRecording = async () => {
  const video = await cameraRef.current.recordAsync({
    maxDuration: 10,      // Max 10 seconds
    quality: '720p',      // HD quality
    mute: false,          // Include audio
  });
  
  if (video && video.uri) {
    await processVideoRecording(video.uri);
  }
};

// Stop Recording
const stopVideoRecording = () => {
  cameraRef.current.stopRecording();
};
```

### Recording Duration Counter
- Updates every 100ms for smooth countdown
- Auto-stops at 10 seconds
- Shows format: "üî¥ Recording 5s / 10s"

### Platform Support
- ‚úÖ **iOS**: Fully supported
- ‚úÖ **Android**: Fully supported
- ‚ùå **Web**: Shows alert (video recording mobile-only)

## Current Limitations

### Video Processing
Currently, the video is recorded successfully, but **frame extraction and analysis** is pending:

```javascript
// TODO: Extract frames from video for analysis
// Options:
// 1. expo-av - Extract frames at intervals
// 2. FFmpeg - More powerful frame extraction
// 3. expo-video-thumbnails - Generate preview frames
```

**Workaround**: User receives alert that video was captured successfully, with recommendation to use photo mode for immediate analysis.

## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Open Camera Scanner
2. Tap toggle button at top to switch to **üé• Video Mode**
3. Tap red record button to start recording
4. Move camera slowly across pantry items
5. Recording auto-stops at 10s, or tap ‚èπ STOP button
6. (Currently shows "Feature Coming Soon" alert)

### For Developers
To complete video processing, install frame extraction library:

```bash
# Option 1: expo-av (recommended)
npx expo install expo-av

# Option 2: expo-video-thumbnails
npx expo install expo-video-thumbnails
```

Then implement frame extraction in `processVideoRecording()`:

```javascript
import { Video } from 'expo-av';
// or
import * as VideoThumbnails from 'expo-video-thumbnails';

const processVideoRecording = async (videoUri) => {
  // Extract frames at 0s, 2s, 4s, 6s, 8s
  const frames = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    const thumbnail = await VideoThumbnails.getThumbnailAsync(videoUri, {
      time: i * 2000, // milliseconds
    });
    frames.push(thumbnail.uri);
  }
  
  // Process each frame through analyzeImage Cloud Function
  // Similar to burst mode processing
  await processBurstImages(frames);
};
```

## API Reference

### expo-camera CameraView Methods

```typescript
// Start recording
recordAsync(options?: CameraRecordingOptions): Promise<{ uri: string } | undefined>

// Stop recording
stopRecording(): void

// Check if video supported
getSupportedFeatures(): {
  toggleRecordingAsyncAvailable: boolean;
}
```

### CameraRecordingOptions
```typescript
{
  maxDuration?: number;    // Seconds
  quality?: '2160p' | '1080p' | '720p' | '480p';
  mute?: boolean;          // true = no audio
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **components/CameraScanner.js**
   - Added video recording state management
   - Implemented `startVideoRecording()` and `stopVideoRecording()`
   - Updated UI with video mode toggle
   - Added recording indicator with timer
   - Added stop button and video styles

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Frame Extraction (High Priority)
- [ ] Install `expo-av` or `expo-video-thumbnails`
- [ ] Extract 5 frames from video (every 2 seconds)
- [ ] Process frames through Cloud Function
- [ ] Deduplicate detected items

### Phase 2: Enhanced Video Processing (Future)
- [ ] Real-time object tracking during recording
- [ ] Optical flow for motion detection
- [ ] Temporal analysis (items that appear in multiple frames = higher confidence)
- [ ] Video compression before upload

### Phase 3: Cloud Function Optimization
- [ ] Accept video files directly (not just images)
- [ ] Server-side frame extraction
- [ ] Batch processing of video frames
- [ ] Return timeline of detected items

## Comparison: Video vs Burst Mode

| Feature | Video Mode | Burst Mode |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Duration | 10 seconds continuous | 5 photos (2 seconds) |
| Analysis | Pending frame extraction | ‚úÖ Immediate |
| Best For | Smooth panning | Quick multi-item scan |
| Processing | Complex (needs frames) | Simple (5 photos) |
| File Size | Larger (~5-10MB) | Smaller (~2-3MB) |

**Recommendation**: Use **Burst Mode** for now until video frame extraction is implemented. Both achieve similar goals (multi-item recognition).

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Toggle between photo and video modes
- [x] Start recording (red button appears)
- [x] Duration counter updates in real-time
- [x] Stop button ends recording early
- [x] Auto-stop at 10 seconds
- [x] Mode toggle disabled during recording
- [ ] Video file saved successfully (check file system)
- [ ] Frame extraction from video
- [ ] Frames analyzed by Cloud Function

## Known Issues

1. **Video Processing Not Complete**: Frame extraction TODO
2. **Web Not Supported**: Video recording is mobile-only
3. **Large File Sizes**: Consider compression before processing
